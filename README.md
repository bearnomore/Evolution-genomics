# Evolution-genomics
### Including python codes for data cleaning and exploring of VCFs exported from Geneious 
The codes will read VCFs of all assembled sequecing mapping to the reference genome, clean the data by removing mutations without impact on translation and overlapping with WT strain (starting strain of evolution) and filtering through Variant frequency. The codes will give gene locations of these mutations.
